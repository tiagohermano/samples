All samples were produced with a circuit bent off-brand/unmarked learning toy. This toy has multiple modes for learning letters and numbers. A pitch control has been fitted, which can cause the toy to crash when clocked fast enough. A switch has also been added to activate a strange pitch glitch mode. Both controls are used throughout the sample set to produce weird sounds. Later samples has been extracted form a glitch stream caused by clocking the toy at its extremes. Samples are 48K/24 bit, with -0.3db normalization applied.
